# Mapping Mini-Project Specification

This is a group project. We're aiming for 3 people per group, but more important than group size is that everyone is working on something that interests them. So if we get some 2-person groups or some 4-person groups, we can work with that.

This project will culminate in two distinct pieces: 1) a short presentation to the class and 2) a digital archive of your team's files. Both are detailed below.

## [](https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/dat_201_sp20/blob/master/files/map_mini_project_specification.md#the-presentation)The presentation:

For the mapping mini-project, you can give the presentation assuming you are talking to a room full of other data analysts with GIS knowledge. You can use jargon and talk in detail about your project, the way you'd talk to experts, rather than carefully crafting a message for a non-expert audience. If you did something especially cool or tricky in QGIS, you can show it to us.

Here are the components your presentation absolutely needs to have:

-   Five minutes or more of content. Try not to go over 10 minutes.
-   The question you set out to answer.
-   A fully-baked map layout.
-   A high-level description of the steps you took.
-   A data-backed claim (or a set of claims) that address your question. Maybe they don't answer it fully, and that's OK, but ...
-   ... if there is more question left after your analysis, tell us what else needs to be done. (This could turn into a project for future students, or could be something you come back to as part of your capstone project.)

## [](https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/dat_201_sp20/blob/master/files/map_mini_project_specification.md#pieces-to-be-turned-in-digitally)Pieces to be turned in digitally:

-   Your presentation components - if you did slides, your slides and speaker notes; if you just talked while showing your map layout and/or QGIS, then you need to turn in some record of your question, your claim(s), and any lingering questions that you'd like to see someone answer.
-   Your processing log, which should be sufficiently detailed that we could hand it to one of your classmates and ask them to create the same map you turned in. (We might actually do this.)
-   A PDF copy of your map layout.
-   Citations of all of your data sources (this can be part of the processing log document—and may have to be, for more complicated-to-get-to pieces of data, like ACS sheets).
-   Documentation of what each group member contributed.
